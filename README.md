calbum
======

__calbum__ is an unattended calendar-based photo organiser. It is meant to allow
easy management of pictures based on their location, date and calendar events
without the need of a database or a special browser to retrieve them.

How it works
------------

Pictures are moved from the _inbox_ folder to the _timeline_ and then linked to
an album based on the time period of an event found in the provided calendar.
Albums are named using the summary of the calendar event.  All characters that
are not allowed in a file name are discarted from the album name. Albums may
be deleted, pictures are kept in the timeline folder.

Usage
-----

    # calbum --help
    usage: calbum [-h] [--inbox path] [--timeline path] [--album path]
                  [--calendar url] [--date-format format] [--save-events]
                  [--time-zone tz]
